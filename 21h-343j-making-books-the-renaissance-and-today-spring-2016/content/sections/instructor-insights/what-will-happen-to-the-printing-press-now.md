_In this section, Professor Jeffrey Ravel describes future plans for the printing press built by students in_ 21H.343J / CC.120J Making Books: The Renaissance and Today_._

{{< quote "We would love it if the press became a key component of a future Center for the Book located in the MIT Libraries." "â€” Jeffrey Ravel" >}}

The [MIT Libraries](https://libraries.mit.edu/?repeat=w3tc) would like to be the home for the printing press built by students in _21H.343J / CC.120J Making Books: The Renaissance and Today._ My co-instructors and I are talking with the Directors of the Archives, the Rare Books Program Manager, and the Paper Conversation Lab Director about possible locations. Our hope is to have the press set up and ready for business in the [Beaver Press Print Shop](http://beaverpress.mit.edu/) by the start of the Fall 2016 term, so that our colleagues in history and other departments on campus can begin to use the press for class exercises. We would love it if the press became a key component of a future Center for the Book located in the MIT Libraries.
